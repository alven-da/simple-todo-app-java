# Todo App - Hexagonal Architecture Demo

This project demonstrates Hexagonal Architecture written in Java. This is a Todo App

In this example, you'll see that:

- REST API (and GraphQL, soon!) are interfaces and can be used as endpoints at the same time
- How MySQL or PostgreSQL are being used interchangeably

### Libraries used
- Spring Boot - for dependency injection
- Lomboc - used for Getters/Setters of entities and DTOs
- JacksonXML - converts Java objects into JSON
